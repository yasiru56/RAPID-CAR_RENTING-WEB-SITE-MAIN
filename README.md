# Rapid-Car-Renting-Web-Site

**Rapid Rent** is a full-stack vehicle rental web application that enables vehicle owners to list and manage their vehicles, and allows renters to browse, book, and save their favorite vehicles. This system offers an intuitive user interface with dedicated dashboards for both owners and renters.

Vehicle owners can add detailed listings including name, brand, type, price, location, and availability. They can edit or delete listings, view incoming booking requests, and generate downloadable reports. Renters can view all available vehicles, apply filters, book cars directly, and track booking statuses in real-time. Additionally, they can save vehicles to their wishlist for later reference.

The platform was developed using **React.js** for the frontend and **Node.js with MongoDB** for the backend, ensuring responsiveness, scalability, and real-time interaction. Bootstrap was used for a clean and modern UI. This project aims to streamline the car rental process for both parties with efficiency and ease.
